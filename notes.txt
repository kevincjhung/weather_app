***** Front End 
- When the user clicks a button, send an appropriate AJAX request 
to the backend

- Process the AJAX response; if the signup/login/logout was successful, 
update the header


***** Back End
- if request is successful, return status 200, with json with session data
- if error, return error with error info
- set backend 


***** Problems
- Will show login/signin page when it says that someone is logged in.

Notes for future
- Separating api requests and app requests with router
- Be careful when you set status codes randomly for testing. Some header statuses such 
    as 'no content' will literally hide the content you send back
